    ## About Me

    From High Energy Astroparticle Physics to Data Science! 

    Based in **Japan**, **Canada**, and **Ecuador** (or anywhere with internet ðŸ˜„).

    I am a **Data Scientist with a physics background**. Over the past few years, I transitioned from being a high-energy astroparticle researcher to embracing the world of data. It was during my time in research that I developed a passion for the analytical and programming aspects of Data Analysis. This revelation led me to pivot my career towards Data Science.

    My journey has seen me undertake diverse and complex projects, spanning various Machine Learning models, intricate feature engineering, and in-depth data analysis. Each venture has been instrumental in sharpening my programming acumen, while also enriching my critical thinking, leadership, and decision-making prowess.

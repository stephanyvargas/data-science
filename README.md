# 📊 My Data Science Portfolio

Hey there! 😊 This is where I dump all the cool stuff I'm learning and doing in data science. Think of it as my digital sandbox where I play with data, algorithms, and sprinkle in some visualizations.

## What's Inside? 📦

- **`app.py`**: The heart of this portfolio. Run this with Streamlit and see the magic unfold!
- **`datasets/`**: All the datasets I tinker with. Some cool, some weird, all interesting!
- **`notebooks/`**: My Jupyter notebooks. This is where I scribble down my data stories, from raw data to shiny insights.
- **`models/`**: Ever wondered how I taught a computer to predict stuff? The secret sauce (read: trained models) is here.
- **`assets/`**: Just some images and stuff to make everything look snazzier.

## Wanna Dive In? 🏊‍♂️

Fire up `app.py` with Streamlit and take a tour!

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Got Suggestions? Or Just Wanna Chat? 🚀

I'm all ears! This is my playground, but I love it when folks drop by with ideas, suggestions, or just to say "hi". If you've got some code improvements or cool ideas, shoot a pull request. If you just wanna chat about data, algorithms, or the meaning of life, hit me up on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephany-vargas)

Stay curious and keep coding! 💻✨
